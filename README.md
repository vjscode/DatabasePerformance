# DatabasePerformance

## Why does this exist?
Whenever you are in a position to choose a DB for your next Android app, you would always hope there is someone who has done a comparitive analysis of all the popular databses in the market. This tool aims to fullfill exactly that.

As a first step, I'm starting with Realm. Hope to see more including leveldb, couchbase lite and the good old sqlite
